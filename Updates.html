    <h2>
        Current Event Date:
    March 19th, 11 AM ET | Online Event
    </h2>
    <p1>
           This event was orginally planned to be an in-person Scanvenger hunt in 2020 starting in Tutle State Park in North Carolina. However, due to Covid-19 it was postponed and has become a virtual event open to all, specifically those in the Appalachian mountains.
           </p1>
        <h3>
           Our team has been working tirelessly for everyone to have a smooth connection to the event and in order for this to happen we are unfortunatley announcing a limit to how many groups may attend. We have decided to have a maximum of 20 groups of 2-4 people as well as a max of 30 groups of 1 person to attend. We are very sorry for this inconvenience, but invite you to join us next year or donate to local conservation groups!
           </h3>
           <p2>
           Current Updates: there are still 5 spots available for groups of 2-4 people as well as 12 spots open for a group of 1.
