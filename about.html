 Over recent years we have noticed the impact humans are having on the enviroment around them, for the blue ridge mountains this means intense tree logging, over-hunting of the local wildlife, and more. We are hoping to be able to make a change against these things, In order to do this we need your help, Half of all proceeds from this even will go towards local conservation groups in order to protect and insure the safety of the land they have.
